Description: The dscore package provides tools for calculating the
    D-score, a quantitative measure of child development. The main 
    function converts milestone scores from various instruments into 
    the D-score and the DAZ (D-score adjusted for age). The user needs
    to map the variable names of each milestone into the 9-position 
    GSED convention. The packages contains tools that assist in this 
    translation.
