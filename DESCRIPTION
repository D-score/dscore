Description: The D-score summarizes the child's performance on a set of 
    milestones into a single number. The package implements four Rasch model
    keys to convert milestone scores into a D-score. It provides tools to 
    calculate the D-score and its precision from the child's milestone scores, 
    to convert the D-score into the Development-for-Age Z-score (DAZ) 
    using age-conditional references, and to map milestone names into a 
    generic 9-position item naming convention.
