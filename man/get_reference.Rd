\title{Get D-score reference}
\usage{
get_reference(population = "phase1", references = dscore::builtin_references)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{A string describing the population. Currently supported
are \code{"dutch"}, \code{"gcdg"}, \code{"phase1"} or \code{"phase1_health"}.
The default is \code{"phase1"}, in sync with the default \code{key = "gsed"}.}

\item{references}{A \code{data.frame} with the same structure
as \code{builtin_references}. The default is to use
\code{builtin_references}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the LMS reference values.
}
\description{
The \code{get_reference()} function selects the D-score reference
distribution.
}
\note{
No references for population \code{"gsed"} exist.
The function will silently rewrite \code{population = "gsed"}
into to the \code{population = "gsed"}.

The \code{"dutch"} reference was published in Van Buuren (2014)
The \code{"gcdg"} was calculated from 15 cohorts with direct
observations (Weber, 2019).
The \code{"phase1"} references were calculated from the GSED Phase 1 validation
data (GSED-BGD, GSED-PAK, GSED-TZA) cover age range 2w-3.5 years. The
age range 3.5-5 yrs is linearly extrapolated and are only indicative.
The \code{"phase1_healthy"} references were calculated from the GSED Phase 1 validation
using a subset of children with healthy development.
