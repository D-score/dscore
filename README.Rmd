The *D*-score is a numerical score that measures generic development 
in children. The *D*-score can be used to analyze and predict 
development of children using tools developed for numerical 
measures, like height and weight.

The `dscore` package contains tools to

- Map your item names to the GSED convention
- Calculate *D*-score from item level responses
- Transform the *D*-scores into DAZ, age-standardised Z-scores

The required input consists of *item level* responses on milestones
from widely used instruments for measuring child development.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stefvanbuuren/dscore")
```

## Overview

You may estimate the *D*-score and the *D*-score age-adjusted Z-score (DAZ) from child data on developmental milestones. Four steps are needed:

1. Identify whether the `dscore` package covers your measurement instrument;
2. Map your variable names to the GSED 9-position schema;
3. Calculate *D*-score and DAZ;
4. Summarise your results.

The `dscore` package provides various function that support these steps. See [Getting started](https://stefvanbuuren.name/dscore/articles/start.html) for more details.
